Instructions to run code:

Make sure that your databases are loaded with data.

serverm --- Mongodb
serverp --- Postgre
serverh --- HBase

We have 3 servers serverm.py, serverp.py and serverh.py.

We have to run all the servers using the command python3 <filename>.py

All 3 servers run on different ports.

We have to run ser.py which has gui for client and runs on local host.
